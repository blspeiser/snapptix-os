This is presented as-is. Keep in mind that this was a bunch of
college students  - with no practical real-world experience but 
lots of ambition - who set out to prove that they could build
something much more interesting than just a working web application. 

This team succeeded in producing a custom Unix distribution
that could be installed on off-the-shelf hardware. It only
supported simple file sharing services (samba), but it did
properly work and failover as expected.
