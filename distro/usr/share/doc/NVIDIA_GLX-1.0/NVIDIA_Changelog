    * Support for AGP 3.0

    * Improved support for NForce2

    * Added support for NV30 and NV30 extensions.

    * Fixed bug where there was corruption at the borders of a pbuffer

    * More complete acceleration for the XRENDER extension.  Due to the
      experimental nature, RENDER acceleration is now disabled by default
      (Option "RenderAccel" enables it).

    * The driver no longer uses the XFree86 Acceleration Architecture (XAA),
      but provides its own 2D acceleration architecture to better accomodate
      the needs of simultaneous 3D and 2D rendering.

    * Added color index overlay emulation on Quadro4.

    * Added support for separate X screens on a single GPU (supported
      by all GPUs that support TwinView).

      enables them.

2002-5-23 version 1.0-2960

    * Fixed problem with loading the GLX extension in multi-head
      environments with non-NVIDIA video cards.

    * Significant performance improvements in Viewperf on Quadro parts.

    * Added option "NoRenderExtension" to disable the RENDER extension.
      This is useful in 8bpp where the RENDER extension will preallocate
      a large portion of the default colormap and break many legacy 
      applications.

    * Fixed a regression where I420 XvImages had the chroma planes swapped.

    * Fixed some problems with moving overlay windows.

    * Added a dynamic XvMC library "libXvMCNVIDIA_dynamic.so" so that 
      applications can dynamically load the vendor-specific core XvMC
      support.

    * Added XvMC motion-compensation acceleration for NV25 and fixed
      some bugs in the NV17 XvMC support.

    * Fixed some problems with FSAA modes failing.

2002-4-3 version 1.0-2880

      GL_SYNC_TO_VBLANK was enabled.

    * Fixed problem where the maximum pixel clock was set too low.
      
    * Fixed a problem with image flicker when running full-screen apps
      on GeForce4.

    * Support for anisotropic filtering.

    * Provide libXvMCNVIDIA.a which is an implementation of XvMC 1.0.
      This allows mpeg acceleration on NV17 chips and NV17 chips only.

    * RGB Workstation overlays for Quadro4.  These are double buffered,
      Z-buffered 16 bit visuals.  The transparency key is 0x0000 hex.

    * NV17 and NV25 support.

    * Added an 8:8:8:8 XRGB XvImage format to the video blitter.

    * Config file option for Digital Vibrance Control.
     
    * Added new XF86Config option "FlatPanelProperties" to control dithering 
      and scaling when X is started.

    * Added support for SoftEDID's. When enabled the driver will generate 
      an EDID based on the video bios isntead of doing a table lookup.

    * Improved Crush support

    * Fixed problem with using SGIX_fbconfig and SGIX_pbuffer with 
      indirect rendering (protocol was incorrect)

    * Fixed problem where the driver would fail on systems with >= 1GB 
      of memory and a kernel configured to use all the memory.

2001-11-26 version 1.0-2313

    * Got Crush working.

    * OpenGL 1.3 support.

    * Added SGIX_pbuffer and SGIX_fbconfig extensions.

    * Added UBB support, pageflipping and window flipping (described in
      README).

      of immediate mode applications.

    * Improved stability on AMD platforms.

    * Fixed TwinView problem that caused garbage to appear on the screen
      when starting X with a null option on head 0.

    * Added workaround for XAA bug that causes system to hang when Lisa
      Screensaver is run.  The problem is worked around by adding the
      following line in the "Device" section of the XF86Config file:
      'Option "XaaNoSolidFillTrap"'.  This option prevents XAA from
      breaking wide lines (and polyggons) into trapezoids and avoids an
      XAA clipping bug.
      
    * Fixed a system hang that occured on some chipsets when taking the
      X server down (after having run once successfully) and restarting
      it while using the DVI-I connected toa flat panel.

    * Fixed problem where the performer application Perfly would hang
      when run in forked-draw mode.

    * Fixed problem where the X driver would segfault when given an
      invalid MetaMode.

    * Fixed problem where the console was not restored properly after
      entering X and returning to the console.

    * Fixed problem where X did not redraw completely after a screen
      blank on GForce 2 Go and Quadro 2 Go.

    * Fixed problem with initializing secondary card. In most cases, the
      secondary card is posted correctly.  In the cases where it isn't,
      there is now a workaround to initialize the card via X.

    * Added workarounds to enable AGP on ALI chipsets and enable 4X AGP
      on VIA chipsets (See README and use with caution!).

2001-08-20 version 1.0-1541

    * Changed behaviour of the X server so the NVIDIA splash screen will
      only show up on the first run of X.  This can also be disabled by
      setting an option in XF86Config (see README).

    * Fixed problem where OpenGL applications would sometimes leave
      portions of their rendering behind when the window was closed
      using the kill button on the window banner.

    * Fixed problem on mobile where X would respond to the wrong hotkey
      event under some conditions.

    * Fixed several more problems with indirect rendering.

    * Fixed problem on SMP machines which occured when VT switching
      while running gloss and gears indirect.

    * Fixed problem where /proc/nv/card0 did not report nv20 correctly.

    * Fixed problem on TNT2, where the driver would only support up to 4
      threads per process.

    * Fixed Xserver crash that occured when running two Xservers with
      AGPgart.

    * Fixed some problems in GLX that occured when running
      multi-threaded  applications.

      a graphical login with xdm/kdm, and doing the following sequence:
      login, mode switch, logout, log in and run a GL app.

    * Fixed some indirect rendering problems.

    * Fixed a problem that caused Xconfigure to fail on NVIDIA drivers.

    * Fixed a crash that occured when X forwarding over SSH.

      hardware scaler on YUV surfaces.

    * Improved X-Render acceleration.

    * Fixed a bug that prevented X-Render acceleration on GeForce3.

    * Fixed X-Video in TwinView.

    * Acceleration for X-Render extension.

    * Fixed up GLXPixmap rendering.

    * Fixed problem with make current to same drawable but different
      dpy.

    * Fixed problem in which OpenGL would segfault when reading X
      atoms.

    * X now gets the DPI (dots per inch) from the monitor's EDID (rather
      than just defaulting to 75 dpi).

    * All DPMS modes are now supported.  There are still issues on flat
      panels and on the second head of a TwinView system (please see the
      README).

    * Fixed support for AGP on systems with 1 GB or more of memory.

2001-02-16 version 0.9-769

    * Fixed problem where direct rendering applications were allowed to
      continue rendering after xkill was called.

    * Fixed problem where Tribes 2 crashed when compressed textures
      (s3tc textures) were used.

    * Some drawable leaks were fixed in X and GLX.

    * Fixed problem where the application would hang when calling
      glXMakeCurrent while holding the X server grab.

    * Bios-posting problems on GeForce2 GTS and GeForce Ultra cards were
      fixed.  This bug resulted in a significant performance loss.

    * Added support for the X Render extension.

    * TwinView functionality was enhanced so that each head can pan 
      independently.

    * Fixed problem on TNT and TNT2 where Xv(Shm)PutImage returned
      BadAlloc in high resolutions when there was not enough video
      bandwidth to display the YUV video overlay correctly. This works
      now but the resulting display has artifacts.

    * Fixed problem with cursor hanges in X.

    * Fixed problem with X console not restoring on some monitors.

    * Fixed problem with fork() and OpenGL rendering.

    * Fixed problem with X driver module, nvidia_drv.o, being stripped
      when RPM was rebuilt.

    * Added missing PCI device ids for some TNT2 variants and GeForce3.

    * Fixed problem where the kernel would often hang during X and/or
      OpenGL operation when on an SMP machine and using the 2.4 kernel.

    * Fixed SYNC_TO_VBLANK hang with 2.4 kernels.

    * DPMS is partially working again. It is possible to set the "off"
      option for dpms.  DPMS options "suspend" and "standby" are not
      fully supported -- they simply blank the screen.
