Supported hardware
------------------

   * Packages on the official CRUX ISO image are compiled with optimization
     for i686 processors (Pentium-Pro/Celeron/Pentium-II or better). Do NOT
     try to install it on an i586 (Pentium, AMD K6/K6-II/K6-III) or lower,
     since it simply will not work. To install CRUX on an i586 system you
     need to download the i586 version of the CRUX ISO image.

   * The kernel used during installation, i.e. when booting from the CRUX
     ISO image (El Torito) is compiled with the following disk controllers
     and USB support:

     Disk controllers

        - IDE     (Generic PCI IDE chipset)

        - SCSI    (7000FASST, ACARD, Adaptec AHA152X/2825, Adaptec AHA1542,
                  Adaptec AHA1740, Adaptec AIC7xxx, AdvanSys, AM53/79C974 PCI,
                  BusLogic, Generic NCR5380/53c400, Initio 9100U(W),
                  Initio INI-A100U2W, NCR53c406a, NCR53C8XX, Simple 53c710,
                  Symbios 53c416, Tekram DC390(T) and Am53/79C974, UltraStor)

     USB support

        - USB device filesystem
        - UHCI (Intel PIIX4, VIA, ...) support
        - USB Human Interface Device (full HID) support
	- HID input layer support

     To be able to install CRUX your disk controller must be present in the
     list above. If your CD-ROM drive does not support bootable ISO images
     you can boot using a floppy drive instead. Just put your linux kernel
     of choice on a floppy disk and make it bootable. Insert both the
     floppy and the CD when booting.


Installation
------------

  1. Download the CRUX ISO image (crux-X.X.X.iso). To ensure that the
     download was successful you should examine its checksum using md5sum.
     Run

             md5sum crux-X.X.X.iso

     and compare the output with the file crux-X.X.X.md5sum, which can be
     found in the same directory as the ISO image on the ftp-site. If the
     checksums match the download was successful and you can continue with
     burning the ISO image on a CD.

  2. The ISO image is bootable, just insert the newly burned CD and reboot
     your computer. Press enter at the boot prompt.

  3. Login as root (no password required).

  4. Create (if necessary) and format the partition(s) you want CRUX to be
     installed on, e.g.:

       fdisk /dev/discs/disc?/disc             (to create partitions)
       mkreiserfs /dev/discs/disc?/part?       (to format a reiserfs partition)
       mkswap /dev/discs/disc?/part?           (to format a swap partition)

     The amount of disk space you need depends on how many packages you
     choose to install. I recommend you to at least have a 1G root partition
     (CRUX will use 200-500M depending on your configuration).

     Using reiserfs is recommended, but there is support for ext2fs/ext3fs
     and JFS as well. Further, it's highly recommended that you to separate
     the system from user data, i.e. use a separate partition for /home (and
     possibly /var) since that will make your life easier the day you want
     to upgrade/reinstall/remove your system.

  5. Mount the partition you want this distribution to be installed on,
     e.g.:

             mount /dev/discs/disc?/part? /mnt

     If you want the installation to be put on more than one partition, then
     mount these partitions as well. E.g. if you want to have a different
     partition for /var, then do like this:

             mkdir /mnt/var
             mount /dev/discs/disc?/part? /mnt/var

     NOTE: This installation guide assumes that you use /mnt as the mount
     point for your new root partition. You can of course use something
     else, just remember to replace all further references to /mnt with your
     mount point.

  6. Activate your swap partition(s) using the swapon command, i.e.:

             swapon /dev/discs/disc?/part?

  7. Run the Setup script to start the package installation. The script will
     ask you where you mounted your new root partition and which packages
     you want to install. Just select the packages you want and nothing else
     will be installed. However, I recommend you to at least install all
     packages marked "base".

     When the Setup script has installed the selected packages an
     installation log will be displayed. Make sure the last line in the log
     says "0 error(s)".

     If you at a later stage find that you need some additional packages you
     can just mount the CRUX CD-ROM and use pkgadd to install them.

     NOTE: There is no package dependency checking.

  8. Edit /mnt/etc/fstab to configure your filesystem(s).

  9. Edit /mnt/etc/rc.conf to configure keyboard, services, and timezone.

 10. Edit /mnt/etc/rc.d/net, /mnt/etc/hosts and /mnt/etc/resolv.conf to
     configure your network (ip-address/gateway/hostname/domain/dns).

 11. Reboot your system (boot from the CRUX CD-ROM again) and type "CRUX
     root=<device>" at the boot prompt. Replace <device> with the name of
     your new CRUX root partition. Remeber that CRUX uses devfs, thus the
     name of your root device should be something like
     /dev/discs/disc?/part?. When CRUX is booting using your new root for
     the first time there might be some error messages printed to the
     console. These errors are most often not vital, but you should keep an
     eye on them. If you reach the login prompt you are most likely home
     safe.

 12. Login as root (no password required).

 13. Change the root password.

 14. Go to /usr/src/linux-2.4.XX, configure and compile a new kernel.
     Remember to at least enable the following kernel options:

           Code maturity level options  --->
                 [*] Prompt for development and/or incomplete code/drivers

           File systems  --->
                 [*] /dev file system support
                 [*]   Automatically mount at boot

 15. Edit /etc/lilo.conf to boot the kernel you just compiled and run lilo
     to make the new system bootable.

 16. Remove the CRUX CD-ROM from your drive and reboot from harddisk.


Upgrade your CRUX installation
------------------------------

  1. Download the CRUX ISO image (crux-X.X.X.iso). To ensure that the
     download was successful you should examine its checksum using md5sum.
     Run

             md5sum crux-X.X.X.iso

     and compare the output with the file crux-X.X.X.md5sum, which can be
     found in the same directory as the ISO image on the ftp-site. If the
     checksums match the download was successful and you can continue with
     burning the ISO image on a CD.

  2. The ISO image is bootable, just insert the newly burned CD and reboot
     your computer. Press enter at the boot prompt.

  3. Login as root (no password required).

  4. Mount your CRUX root partition.

             mount /dev/discs/disc?/part? /mnt

     If your installation spans over more than one partition, then
     mount these partitions as well. E.g. if you have a different
     partition for /var, then do like this:

             mount /dev/discs/disc?/part? /mnt/var

     NOTE: This installation guide assumes that you use /mnt as the mount
     point for your root partition. You can of course use something
     else, just remember to replace all further references to /mnt with
     your mount point.

  5. Activate your swap partition(s) using the swapon command, i.e.:

             swapon /dev/discs/disc?/part?

  6. Run the Setup script to start the package upgrade. The script will
     ask you where you mounted your root partition and which packages
     you want to upgrade. It is a good idea to upgrade all packages, else
     you might get into trouble later, e.g. in case some new library isn't
     100% backwards compatible.

     When the Setup script has upgraded the selected packages a log will
     will be displayed. Make sure the last line in the log says "0 error(s)".

     If you at a later stage find that you need some additional packages you
     can just mount the CRUX CD-ROM and use pkgadd to install them.

     NOTE: There is no package dependency checking.

  7. Reboot your system (boot from the CRUX CD-ROM again) and type "CRUX
     root=<device>" at the boot prompt. Replace <device> with the name of
     your CRUX root partition. Remeber that CRUX uses devfs, thus the
     name of your root device should be something like
     /dev/discs/disc?/part?. When CRUX is booting using your upgraded root
     for the first time there might be some error messages printed to the
     console. These errors are most often not vital, but you should keep an
     eye on them. If you reach the login prompt you are most likely home
     safe.

  8. Go to /usr/src/linux-2.4.XX, configure and compile a new kernel.
     Remember to at least enable the following kernel options:

           Code maturity level options  --->
                 [*] Prompt for development and/or incomplete code/drivers

           File systems  --->
                 [*] /dev file system support
                 [*]   Automatically mount at boot

  9. Edit /etc/lilo.conf to boot the kernel you just compiled and run lilo
     to make the new system bootable.

 10. Remove the CRUX CD-ROM from your drive and reboot from harddisk.
