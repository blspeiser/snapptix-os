Java GUI
Java Swing-based UI for Snapptix OS
Developed in Borland JBuilder 9 with dependencies on custom JBuilder Swing layout libraries, JDK 1.3 (likely can no longer be compiled as-is). 
Folder structure conformed to JBuilder module recommendations, for better or for worse.

Developed by Ben (Baruch) Speiser, with assistance from Mehul Shah
